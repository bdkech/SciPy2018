#### Yash Katariya @yashk2810
#### Amit Patnkar

##### Notes
[workshops](https://github.com/tensorflow/workshops)

[Google crash course on machine learning](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/)

[GANS](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/eager/python/examples/gan)

[Auto complete drawing] (https://magenta.tensorflow.org/)

[Google facets](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/)

[Tensorflow wide and deep](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide_and_deep)

Four new API styles with recent release:
- tf.keras
- Eager execution
- Estimators
- Deferred Execution

Notebooks are downloaded and will be in the same directory as this project.

Refer to the regression notebook for good code snippets w/r/t running
models/early stoppage/and classes

"Networks are happiest with data scaled from [-1,1] or [0,1]"

L1 regularization may aid in the testing validation/loss but not the training.  

JS tensorflow allows model interaction from the web now.  [JS
tensorflow](js.tensorflow.org)


May be worth getting the deep learning and python book from manning publications
###### Eager execution
Must be called immediately after the import.  This doesn't do graph-based
execution and does not need a session.


There is a large performance penalty for using this.  But it makes debugging
easier, and allows the generation of models otherwise impossible

##### Thoughts
Free web based jupyter notebook called [Colab](colab.research.google.com), offered from Google.
A free gpu-accelerated jupyter instance offered by Google.  We've heard of them, right?

Man even tensorflow is using keras.  You can now write your models in Keras and then import them

Literally just said "Because we're google we logged your data"

Last year everyone was having you check out github projects, now it seems like
everyone has some cloud hosted service to work on.
